Data analysis of single-molecule, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements (TRAMs).

TRAMs are state-of-the-art technique that can be used to analyse protein function and interaction. 
By measuring the depolarisation of light, it is possible to measure the speed of rotation of fluorescent molecules. Alternatively, this can be used to measure FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent proteins, which gives information on their proximity.

### What is this repository for? ###

* fit curves to TRAM data
* extract useful summaries
* collect and organise data

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install Anaconda python 3.x
* Download blitzcurve as zip, or install using git
* Run setup.py

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Mark Teese
